# Cloud Pilot

Cloud Pilot is a container orchestration system, inspired by Kubernetes. This system provides a scalable, robust, and efficient way to manage containerized applications across multiple hosts.

## Features

* Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Cloud Pilot progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time.

* Service discovery and load balancing: Cloud Pilot can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address.

* Storage orchestration: Cloud Pilot allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storage, or storage from a public cloud provider.

* Self-healing: Cloud Pilot restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don’t respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.

* Secret and configuration management: Cloud Pilot lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys.
